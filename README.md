# node-i2cssh
i2cssh with the support of osascript and node.
It is highly inspired by the original [i2cssh](https://github.com/wouterdebie/i2cssh) and the AppleScript version of it ([i2cssh](https://github.com/djui/i2cssh)).
It only runs from within [iTerm2 (>2.9)](https://iterm2.com/)!.
The goal of this project is to create an alternative that is working with the newest iTerm2 and enhance it with features for the cloud like ssh to all ec2 instances that have a special tag.

## Installation
`npm -g install node-i2cssh`

## Usage
`i2cssh 1.example.com 2.example.com 3.example.com`

## Configuration

by default, node-i2cssh is checking for a file called .i2csshrc in the users home directory. This can be overwritten with the -C option.
see i2csshrc.example.yml for an annotated example configuration

## Options

### -C --config
overwrites the default config file location
`i2cssh -C ~/workspace/gitrepo/i2csshconfig.yml`

### -c --clusters
adds the given clusters hosts from the config to the hosts to connect to.
`i2cssh -c dev -c staging`

### -b --broadcast
starts the broadcast mode immediatly after all tabs are created
`i2cssh -b foo1.bar foo2.bar foo3.bar`

### -t --tags
ec2 tag in the format of $NAME=$VALUE (the `=` separator can be overridden in .i2csshrc -- see i2csshrc.example.yml).
`i2cssh -t env=staging -t end=dev`
Optionally: you can run
`i2cssh -t`
to get asked to which tag you want to connect to. Downside: you can only choose one key-value pair.

### -u --user
Change the username to connect with
`i2cssh -u philipp foo1.bar`
results in `ssh philipp@foo1.bar`

## EC2 Integration
For the EC2 integration to work, you need to have `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` set as environment variables.
I recommend using [envchain](https://github.com/sorah/envchain) and creating some alias for i2cssh wrapping it into envchain like
`alias i2cssh="envchain aws i2cssh $@"`
You'll also need to defined the aws region in your .i2csshrc. see the example config for more information

## ToDo

- fully support original .i2csshrc
  - login: <username>           # Use this username for login
  - profile: <iTerm2 profile>   # Use this iTerm profile
  - rank: (true/false)          # Enable sending LC_RANK as an environment variable
  - columns: <cols>             # Amount of columns
  - rows: <rows>                # Amount of rows
  - sleep: <secs>               # Seconds to sleep between creating SSH sessions
  - environment:                # Send the following enviroment variables
- fully support original command line options
  - -m, --machines a,b,c             Comma-separated list of hosts
  - -f, --file FILE                  Cluster file (one hostname per line)
  - -A, --forward-agent              Enable SSH agent forwarding
  - -e, --environment KEY=VAL        Send environment vars (comma-separated list, need to start with LC_)
  - -r, --rank                       Send LC_RANK with the host number as environment variable
  - -F, --fullscreen                 Make the window fullscreen
  - --columns COLUMNS            Number of columns (rows will be calculated)
  - --rows ROWS                  Number of rows (columns will be calculated)
  - -nb, --nobroadcast               Disable broadcast
  - -p, --profile PROFILE            Name of the iTerm2 profile (default: Default)
  - -s, --sleep SLEEP                Number of seconds to sleep between creating SSH sessions
  - -X, --extra EXTRA_PARAM          Additional ssh parameters (e.g. -Xi=myidentity.pem)
- document
